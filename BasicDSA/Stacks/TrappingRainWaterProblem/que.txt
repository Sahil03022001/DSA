Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1. Compute how much water it can trap after rain.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer input n, the size of the array.

The second line contains n space-separated integers (arr[i]) that describe the width of each bar.

Output Format:
Prints a single integer value, which represents the amount of water it can hold.

Example 1:


Input:

12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1
Output:

6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:
Input:

6
4 2 0 3 2 5
Output:

9
Explanation: In this case, 9 units of rainwater will be trapped.

Constraints:
n == height.length

1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4

0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
