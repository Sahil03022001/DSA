You are given a pattern of up to 8 lengths containing characters 'i' and 'd'. 'd' stands for decreasing and 'i' stands for increasing. You have to print the smallest number, using the digits 1 to 9 only without repetition, such that the digit decreases following a 'd' and increases following 'i'.

e.g.

d -> 21
i -> 12
ddd -> 4321
iii -> 1234
dddiddd -> 43218765
iiddd -> 126543
Input Format
The single line of input contains the pattern string.

Output Format
Smallest sequence of digits (from 1 to 9) without duplicacy and following the pattern

Example 1
Input

ddd
Output

4321
Explanation
Since all the alphabets are 'd' hence is an ever decreasing sequence and the lowest possible number is '4321'.

Example 2
Input

i
Output

12
Explanation
Since there is only a single 'i' so the smallest possible number following this pattern is '12'.

Constraints:
1 <= str.length <= 8
