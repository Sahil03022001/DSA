You are given an infix expression.

You are required to evaluate it and print it's value. You are also required to convert it to postfix and prefix print both of them.

Input Format
The first line contains a string s, denoting the infix expression.

Output Format
In the first line of Output print, the answer is evaluated.

In the second line, print the postfix expression.

In the last line, print the prefix expression.

Example 1
Input

((2+((6*4)/8))-3)
Output

2
264*8/+3-
-+2/*6483
Explanation

The evaluated expression is printed in the first line.

The infix to postfix expression is printed in the second line.

The infix-to-prefix expression is printed in the third line.

Example 2
Input

((1+2)+((((3*4)/5)*6)/7))
Output

4
12+34*5/6*7/+
++12/*/*34567
Explanation

The evaluated expression is printed in the first line.

The infix to postfix expression is printed in the second line.

The infix-to-prefix expression is printed in the third line.

Constraints
Expression is a valid prefix expression

The only operators used are +, -, *, /
