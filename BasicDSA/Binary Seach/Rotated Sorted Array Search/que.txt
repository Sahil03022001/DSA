Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 ).

You are given a target value, B, to search. If found in the array, print its index; otherwise, print -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Note

Array A was sorted in non-decreasing order before rotation.

You need to think of an O(log n) solution.

Input Format
The first line given is an integer N, denoting the size of array A.

The second line given is N integers, the elements of array A.

The third line given is the integer B.

Output Format
Print index of B in array A; otherwise, print -1.

Example 1
Input

8
4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3
4
Output

0
Explanation

Target 4 is found at index 0 in A.

Example 2
Input

4
5 17 100 3
6
Output

-1
Explanation

6 is not present in the array.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000

1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

all elements in A are distinct.
