Given a binary tree a, you need to compute the size, sum, maximum and height of the tree. You must complete the function bodies for each of these functions.

Input Format
The only line of the input contains the elements of the tree in level order form separated by a space. A null node is represented by the character N. The input ends when the last node is processed.

Output Format
The first line contains the size of the tree.

The second line contains the sum of the tree.

The third line contains the maximum value in the tree.

The fourth line contains the height of the tree.

Example 1
Input

1 2 3 4 5 N N N N N N
Output

5
15
5
3
Explanation

The tree looks like this:

        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \
   4   5
The size of the tree is 5, the sum of the tree is 15, the maximum value in the tree is 5 and the height of the tree is 3.

Example 2
Input

1 2 N 3 N 4 N N N
Output

4
10
4
4
Constraints
1 <= n <= 10000
1 <= a[i] <= 10000
