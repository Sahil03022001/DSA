You need to complete a function that traverses a binary tree using a preorder traversal and prints all the nodes that have only one child.

The traversal and printing of the nodes should be done in separate lines.

The input and output for the function have already been implemented.

Input Format
Input has been already implemented (it is a pre-order traversal of the tree)

Output Format
You need to print the single nodes in a preorder fashion.

Example 1
Input

19
50 25 12 n n 37 30 n n n 75 62 n 70 n n 87 n n
Output

30 70
Explanation

            50
    25              75
12      37      62      87
      30           70

Here we can see that only 30 and 70 have parents who have only 1 child.
Example 2
Input

15
50 25 12 n n n 75 62 30 n n n 87 n n
Output

12 30
Explanation

            50
    25              75
12                62      87
                30

Here we can see that only 12 and 30 have parents who have only 1 child.
Constraints
1 <= numOfNodes <=10^5

-10^6 <= node.data <= 10^6
