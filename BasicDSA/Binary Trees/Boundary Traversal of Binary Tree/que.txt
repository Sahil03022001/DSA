Given a binary tree, print boundary nodes of the binary tree Anti-Clockwise starting from the root.

 The boundary includes:

left boundary (nodes on left excluding leaf nodes)

leaves (consist of only the leaf nodes)

right boundary (nodes on right excluding leaf nodes)

Input Format
First line consists of an integer n, the number of nodes in the first binary tree.

The next line contains n spaced integers, representing the level order traversal of the binary tree.

Output Format
Print true if the binary trees are identical, else print false.

Example 1
Input

8
20 8 22 4 12 25 10 14
Output

20 8 4 10 14 25 22

Boundary order traversal: Left boundary -> leaf nodes -> right boundary. Boundary order traversal is 20 8 4 10 14 25 22 
Constraints
0 <= n <= 1000

-10^4 <= node.value <= 10^4
