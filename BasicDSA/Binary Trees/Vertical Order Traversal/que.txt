You are given root of a binary tree, your task is to print the nodes in order obtained via vertical traversal of the tree.

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).

Input Format
The first line contains the number of test cases.

For each test case: You are given a pointer to the root of the binary tree.

Output Format
Complete the function VerticalTraversal() which returns a 2D array containing nodes according the question.

Example 1
Input

1
1 2 3
Output

2
1
3
Explanation

The tree can be imagined as

  1
 / \
2   3
So according to vertical traversal, we have {{2}, {1}, {3}}

Example 2
Input

1
3 9 20 N N 15 7
Output

9
3 15
20
7
Explanation

The tree can be imagined as

  3
 / \
9  20
  /  \
 15   7
Constraints
1 <= number of testcases <= 10

1 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 1000

1 <= nodes.val <= 1000
