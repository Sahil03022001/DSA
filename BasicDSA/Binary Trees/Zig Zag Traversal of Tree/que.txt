Given the root node of a tree, print its nodes in zig zag order, i.e. print the first level left to right, next level right to left, third level left to right and so on.

Note

You need to complete the given function. The input and printing of output will be handled by the driver code.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a string represeting the nodes, N is to show null node.

Output Format
For each test case print the nodes of the tree in zig zag traversal.

Example 1
Input

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Output

1 3 2 4 5 6 7
Explanation

Original tree was:
              1
           /    \
          2      3
         / \    / \
        4   5  6   7

After Zig Zag traversal, tree formed would be:

              1
           /    \
          3      2
         / \    / \
        4   5  6   7
Example 2
Input

5 8 7
Output

5 7 8
Explanation

Original Tree was:

        5
       / \
      8   7

New tree formed is:

        5
       / \
      7   8
Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^5

Value of any node is less than 2^32
