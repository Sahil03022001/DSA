Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a number n.

The second line of input contains n space seperated integer.

Output Format
Return the maximum width of the given tree.

Example 1
Input

7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Output

4
Explanation

The given binary tree is 
            1
          /   \
         2     3
        / \   / \
       4   5 6   7
the maximum width is at 3rd level {4,5,6,7}
Example 2
Input

4
1 2 3 4
Output

2
Explanation

The given tree is
            1
          /   \
         2     3
        /  
       4
The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).
Constraints
1 <= n <= 103
