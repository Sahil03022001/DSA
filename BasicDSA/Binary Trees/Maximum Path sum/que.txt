You are given a binary tree.

Your task is to find the maximum path sum in the given binary tree.

Note

The path can start and end at any node.

You are given a pointer to the root of the binary tree.

You don't need to take input. You need to complete the given function.

Input Format
Input has been managed for you.

In example input, the first line contains the number of test cases.

The next line contains the input to the graph.

Output Format
For each test case, return an integer denoting the maximum sum.

Example 1
Input

1
1 2 3 N N N N
Output

6
Explanation

The tree looks like this:
    1
   / \
  2   3

Path 2 -> 1 -> 3 gives the maximum sum. Thus, the answer is 6.
Example 2
Input

1
5 4 3 -5 N N N N N
Output

12
Explanation

The tree looks like this:
      5
    /   \
   4     3
  /
 -5

Path 4 -> 5 -> 3 gives the maximum sum. Thus, the answer is 12.
Constraints
1 <= Number of nodes <= 1000

-1000 <= Value of node <= 1000
