Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

A height balanced tree is a tree in which absolute difference of the left and right subtrees for every node is less than or eual to 1.

Input Format
First line consists of an integer n, the number of nodes in the binary tree

The next line contains n spaced integers, representing the level order traversal of the binary tree

Output Format
Print true if the binary tree is height balanced else print false

Example 1
Input

5
3 9 20 15 7
Output

false
Explanation

Left and right subtree difference for atleast one node is > 1

Example 2
Input

7
1 2 2 3 3 4 4
Output

false
Explanation

Left and right subtree difference for node 1 itself is 2 (> 1)

Constraints
0 <= n <= 5000

-10^4 <= node.value <= 10^4
