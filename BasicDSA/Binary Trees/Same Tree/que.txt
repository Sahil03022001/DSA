Given two root nodes of two separate binary trees a and b, check whether the trees are identical.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they have identical shapes, and the corresponding nodes have the same value.

Input Format
You are given two separate binary trees a and b in separate lines.

Output Format
For each test case print "YES" if the trees are identical, else print "NO"
