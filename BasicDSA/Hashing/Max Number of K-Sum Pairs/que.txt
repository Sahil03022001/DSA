You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

Input Format
Input consists of two lines.

First line contains an integer n which is the size of nums array.

Next line contains n spaced integers which are the elements of nums.

The last line contains k.

Output Format
Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

Example 1
Input

4
1 2 3 4
5
Output

2
Explanation

Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:

Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = [] There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
Example 2
Input

5
3 1 3 4 3
6
Output

1
Explanation

Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:

Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3] There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5

1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

0 <= k <= 10^9
