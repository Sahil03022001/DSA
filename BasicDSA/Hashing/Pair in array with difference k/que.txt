You are given an array a of n integers and an integer k.

Your task is to return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

A k-diff pair is an integer pair (nums[i], nums[j]), where the following are true:

0 <= i, j < nums.length

i != j

nums[i] - nums[j] == k

Input Format
The first line contains two integers n and k.

The second line contains n space seperated integers.

Output Format
Return an integer denoting the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

Example 1
Input

5 2
3 1 4 1 5
Output

2
Explanation

There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.
Example 2
Input

5 0
1 3 1 5 4
Output

1
Explanation

There is one 0-diff pair in the array, (1, 1).
Constraints
1 <= n <= 10000

0 <= k <= 10^7

1 <= a[i] <= 10^7
