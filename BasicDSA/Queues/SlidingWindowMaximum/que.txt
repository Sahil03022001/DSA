You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the maximum of each sliding window.

Complete the given function SlidingWindowMaximum which receives the input array, n and k as its parameters and returns an array containing maximum of each window of size k.

Input Format
The first line contains N and K denoting the number of elements in the array/list and value of k.

The second line contains N single space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

NOTE: You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of.

Just Complete the function.

Output Format
Print the max sliding window.
