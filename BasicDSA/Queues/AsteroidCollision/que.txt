You are given an array asteroids representing integers in a row.

The absolute value of asteroids[i] represents the weight of the ith asteroid and its sign represents the direction in which it is moving.

Find the final state of the asteroids after collision, assuming the following things:

If two asteroids of different sizes meet, the smaller one explodes
If two asteroids of same sizes meet, both of them explodes
Two asteroids moving in the same direction never meet
Input Format
First line contains an integer n, representing the size of array asteroids

Second line consists of n spaced integers

Output Format
Print the final array of the states of all the asteroids after collision (it may be of less size than the original array)

Example 1
Input

3
5 10 -5
Output

5 10
Explanation

The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.

Example 2
Input

2
8 -8
Output

Explanation

The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.

Constraints
2 <= asteroids.length <= 10^4

-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000

asteroids[i] != 0
