You have given string str of digits.

You are required to encode the str as per the following rules

    1 -> a
    2 -> b
    3 -> c
    ..
    25 -> y
    26 -> z
Your task is to calculate all the possible encodings and print them in new line. If no encoding is possible, print nothing.

Note: print all the possible encodings in lexographical manner.

Input Format
First line contains the string str

Output Format
Print the various encodings in new line.

Example 1
Input

123
Output

abc
aw
lc
Explanation

We have three encoding, abc => {1,2,3}, aw => {1, 23}, lc => {12, 3}

Example 2
Input

013
Output

Explanation

String starts with 0, which makes it invalid.

Example 3
Input

303
Output

Explanation

We have no encoding as we can split str as {3, 0, 3}, {30, 3}, or {3, 03}. In {3, 0, 3} we dont have a character for 0. In {30, 3} we dont have a character for 30. In {3, 03}, 03 is invalid.

Constraints
0 <= str.length <= 10
