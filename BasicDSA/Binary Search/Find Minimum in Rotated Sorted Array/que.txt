Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.

[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, print the minimum element of this array.

Note: Write an algorithm that runs in O(logn) time.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n, number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing array nums.

Output Format
Print a single number â€” the minimum element of this array.

Example 1
Input

5
3 4 5 1 2
Output

1
Explanation

The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 4 times.

Example 2
Input

7
4 5 6 7 0 1 2
Output

0
Explanation

The original array was [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] rotated 3 times.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 5000

-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000

All the integers of nums are unique.
