Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, print[-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Input Format
The first line contains two integers n (number of elements in the array) and target.

The second line contains n integers (value of elements in the array).

Output Format
Print two space separated integers denoting the first and last index of target.

Example 1
Input

 6 8
 5 7 7 8 8 10
Output

 3 4
Explanation

8 occurs for the first time at index 3 and at index 4 for the last time.

Example 2
Input

 6 6
 5 7 7 8 8 10
Output

 -1 -1
Explanation

6 doesn't occur in the given array, hence we return -1 -1

Constraints
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

nums is a non-decreasing array.

-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
