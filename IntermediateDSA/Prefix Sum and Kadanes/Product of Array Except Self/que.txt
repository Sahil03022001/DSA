Given an array of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Expected Time Complexity:O(n)

Input Format
line 1: contains an integer n denoting number of elements in array.

line 2: contains n separated integers denoting elements of array. All integers are greater than 0.

Output Format
Print an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example 1
Input

4
4 3 2 10
Output

60 80 120 24
Explanation

Product of array except 4 is 3*2*10=60
Product of array except 3 is 4*2*10=80
Product of array except 2 is 4*3*10=120
Product of array except 10 is 4*3*2=24

Example 2
Input

5
1 2 3 4 5
Output

120 60 40 30 24
Explanation

Product of array except 1 is 2*3*4*5=120
Product of array except 2 is 1*3*4*5=60
Product of array except 3 is 1*2*4*5=40
Product of array except 4 is 1*2*3*5=30
Product of array except 5 is 1*2*3*4=24
