You are given an array arr of positive integers. You are also given some queries where queries[i] = [lefti, righti].

For each queryi compute the XOR of elements of the array arr from index lefti to righti (arr[lefti] XOR arr[lefti + 1] XOR ... XOR arr[righti]).

Return an array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.

Input Format
The first line of contains two positive integers N and Q, denoting the number of elements in the arr and the number of queries respectively.

The second line contains N space-separated integers depicting the values of an array.

The next Q lines contain two positive integers lefti and righti as described in the problem statement.

Output Format
Print the required array.

Example 1
Input

4 4
1 3 4 8
0 1
1 2
0 3
3 3
Output

2 7 14 8 
Explanation

The binary representation of the elements in the array are:

1 = 0001

3 = 0011

4 = 0100

8 = 1000

The XOR values for queries are:

[0,1] = 1 xor 3 = 2

[1,2] = 3 xor 4 = 7

[0,3] = 1 xor 3 xor 4 xor 8 = 14

[3,3] = 8

Example 2
Input

4 4
4 8 2 10
2 3
1 3
0 0
0 3
Output

8 0 4 4 
Explanation

Find the binary representation of elements, and find the xor of ranges.

Constraints
1 <= N, Q <= 3 * 10^4

1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

queries[i].length == 2

0 <= lefti <= righti < arr.length
