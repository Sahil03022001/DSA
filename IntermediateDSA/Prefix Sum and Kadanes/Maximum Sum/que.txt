You are given an array A of N integers. You are also given another array ops describing operations where ops[i] = (l, r). l and r are 0-indexed. For every pair in ops calculate the sum of A[l] + A[l+1] +...+ A[r-1] + A[r].

Your score is the sum of all the answers from ops. You have to find the maximum score possible, if you can arrange the array A in any order.

The answer can be very large, so return it modulo 1000000007.

Note Complete the given function. The input and output would be handled by the driver code.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer N.

The second line contains N space-separated integers of array A.

The next line contains a single integer M denoting the size of ops.

The next M lines contain two integers each, of the array ops.

Output Format
Print the answer in a new line.

Example 1
Input

5
2 1 3 5 4
2
0 1
1 2
Output

17
Explanation

The permutation [3, 5, 4, 1, 2] is one of the answers that yield maximum sum.

A[0] + A[1] = 8.

A[1] + A[2] = 9.

8 + 9 = 17.

Example 2
Input

4
2 3 5 4
2
0 1
1 3
Output

19
Explanation

The permutation [3, 5, 4, 2] is one of the answers that yield maximum sum.

A[0] + A[1] = 8.

A[1] + A[2] + A[2]= 11.

8 + 11 = 19.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10000

1 <= A[i] <= 10000

1 <= M <= 10000

0 <= ops[i][j] < N
