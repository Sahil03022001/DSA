You are given a 2D matrix grid of size n * m. You have to find the number of distinct islands where a group of connected 1s (horizontally or vertically) forms an island. Two islands are considered to be distinct if and only if one island is not equal to another (rotated or reflected islands are not euqal).

Input Format
The first line contains two integers value of N and M.

Next N line contains M boolean values where 1 denotes land and 0 denotes water.

Output Format
Print total number of distinct islands.

Example 1
Input

3 4
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0
Output

3
Explanation

There are only 3 distinct islands.

1 1 in row 1
1 in row 2
down right
1 1 1 in row 3
Example 2
Input

3 4
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0
Output

2
Explanation

There are 3 islands once again, but island in row 1 and row 3 are not distinct, hence only 2 distinct islands.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 500

1 <= M <= 500
