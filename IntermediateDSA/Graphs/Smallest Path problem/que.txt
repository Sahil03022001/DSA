You are given a graph, a source vertex, and a destination vertex.

You are also given a number named "criteria" and a number "k".

You are required to find and print the values of the Smallest path and its weight separated by an "@", just the Larger path (than criteria in terms of weight), also known as ceil path, and its weight separated by an "@" and finally Kth largest path, and it's weight separated by an "@".

Input Format
Input has been managed for you.

Output Format
Output has been managed for you. You just need to give correct values to the variables already initialized for you.
