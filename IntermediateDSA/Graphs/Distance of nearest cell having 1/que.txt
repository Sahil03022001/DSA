Given a binary grid of n*m. Find the distance of the nearest 1 in the grid for each cell.

The distance is calculated as |i1 - i2| + |j1 - j2|, where i1, j1 are the row number and column number of the current cell, and i2, j2 are the row number and column number of the nearest cell having value 1.

Input Format
The first line of input contains two integers, n and m respectively.

The next n lines contains m integers representing binary grid.

Output Format
Return the distance of the nearest 1 in the grid for each cell.
