You are given a number N, the number of courses you have to take labeled from 0 t N-1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

eg: [2,4] means take course 4 before you can take course 2.

Return the order in which you need to take courses (if multiple orders are possible, print the node with smaller value first).

(You only need to return empty array from the function if no such ordering is possible).

Input Format
The First line of input contain two integers N denoting number of people and M denoting size of prerequisites array.

Next line contains two integer each denoting ai and bi.

Output Format
Print the order in which you need to take courses (if multiple orders are possible, print the node with smaller value first), else return an empty array.

Example 1
Input

4 3
1 2
1 3
1 0
Output

0 2 3 1
Explanation

We need to take course 2,3 and 0 before taking course 1. Since no conflict is there, we can take it.

Example 2
Input

4 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
Output

-1
Explanation

The prerequisites for each course can be mapped as

1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 1
Any two of these courses can be done without any issue, but when the third course comes in, the prerequisite of the prerequisite becomes one the course you need to take and it's impossible to take all of it.

Constraints
1 <= N <=2000

0 <= M <= 5000

1 <= prerequisite[i][j] < N
