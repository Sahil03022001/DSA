We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.

Given the integer n and the array dislikes where dislikes[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that the person labeled ai does not like the person labeled bi, return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

Input Format
The First line of input contain two integers N denoting number of people and M denoting size of dislike array.

Next line contains two integer each denoting ai and bi.

Output Format
print 1 if it is possible to split everyone into two groups else print 0.

Example 1
Input

4 3
1 2
1 3
1 4
Output

1
Explanation

We can divide the array into two parts. The two groups are {1} and {2,3,4}.

Example 2
Input

3 3
1 2
1 3
2 3
Output

0
Explanation

Since 1 hates 2 and 3, it can't be grouped with them, and since 2 hates 3, 2 and 3 can't be together either. Hence we need at least three groups to keep all the people who don't like each other separately, but we need to divide only in 2.

Constraints
1 <= N <=2000

0 <= M <= 10^4

1 <= dislikes[i][j] <=2

ai < bi

0 <= |arr[i]| <= 2
