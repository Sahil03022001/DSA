A Hamilton path is a path in an undirected graph that visits each vertex exactly once. Given an undirected graph, the task is to check if a Hamilton path is in it or not.

Input Format
The first line consists of two space separated integers N and M denoting the number of vertices and number of edges.

Then in the next M line are 2 space separated integers u,v denoting an undirected edge between u and v.

Output Format
Return true if the graph consists Hamilton cycles, else return false.

Explanation

It can be proved that there is no hamilton path in the graph.

1
Explanation

The graph is 
  1-----2-----3-----4
        |           |
        |           |
        |------------

The Hamilton path is 1-2-3-4
Constraints
1 <= N <= 10

1 <= M <= 15

1 <= value of each node <= N
